{"body":"This projects collects all published (aka tagged) Symfony Standard Distribution releases to ease the author's update workflow.\r\n\r\n# \"Official\" update workflow\r\n\r\nAfter the installation of the setup, you usually creates a clean git repository over the latest version of Symfony Standard Distribution and do no track changes ([Source control on a composer-created framework project](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/symfony2/TFHgbsuDx9U/discussion)).\r\n\r\nThe \"official\" update process involves download the new composer or deps related files and run the suitable vendor manager to obtain new versions (see [Symfony 2.1.3 released](http://symfony.com/blog/symfony-2-1-3-released)). This works but some files are not updated. In almost all cases this is not really a issue.\r\n\r\n# \"Alternative\" update workflow\r\n\r\nThe alternative uses merge of latest versions (provides by this repository as a remote) into the ```master``` branch of the code repository. This merges provides updated versions of composer and deps files and all related stuff of the distribution.\r\n\r\n## Initial setup\r\n\r\nWhen starting a new project:\r\n\r\n1. Add this repository as remote ```git remote add symfony-standard http://github.com/ocubom/symfony-standard-releases.git```\r\n2. Create your ```master``` branch from one version ```git checkout -b master symfony-standard/2.1 # or 2.0```\r\n3. Install vendors ```composer install```\r\n\r\nThe workflow can be also used on an existing project. In this case, the first setup is a bit more complex as it requires an initial merge.\r\n\r\n1. Add this repository as remote ```git remote add symfony-standard http://github.com/ocubom/symfony-standard-releases.git```\r\n2. Merge the version you prefer into your ```master``` branch.\r\n\r\n## Upgrade\r\n\r\nAfter the initial setup, the upgrade will be fast:\r\n\r\n1. Get latest changes in remote repository: ```git remote update```\r\n2. Merge latest version into your master branch: ```git merge symfony-standard/2.1 # or 2.0```. This may generate some conflicts that you must solve by hand.\r\n\r\n# Note\r\n\r\nThis repository contains just clones of the original commits tagged on the original [Symfony Standard Distribution](http://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard) repository. Original author and dates are maintained.","note":"Don't delete this file!
